Good news, bad news, and a question
===============================================
Good news: anvi'o finished parsing kaiju taxonomy output. Bad news: it has no
idea whether it did well or not. Because the user can ask kaiju to report
certain taxonomic levels, but can't ask anvi'o to utilize that information. So
anvi'o always assumes you started from the domain-level, and followed the
conventional levels of taxonomy. Here is your question. We randomly picked some
phylum names from your input taoxnomy as anvi'o parsed them. Here they are:
'Unknown_Eukaryota, Proteobacteria, Blastocladiomycota, Mucoromycota,
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Basidiomycota'. Do they look like phylum names to
you? If they don't, you are in very big trouble :( The best way to get yourself
out of trouble is to immediately press CTRL-C, turn your computer off, and move
permanently to Cuba since you are done here (if you are already in Cuba, please
let us know for more instructions).
